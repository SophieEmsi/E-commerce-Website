## Project Description

This E-Commerce Website is an online platform that aims to provide users with a simulated shopping experience. Inspired by the desire to develop a user-friendly and engaging e-commerce platform, we developed this website using the Fake Store API.

The primary goal of the Levels E-Commerce Website is to offer users a diverse range of products across various categories. Users can explore the product catalog, which includes detailed titles and high quality imagery. The website also divides the shopping departments into clear and easily accessible links throughout the webpages.

To enhance the shopping experience, the website incorporates a shopping cart feature. Users can easily add products to their cart, review the contents and total, and update quantities. Moving forward, our focus for this website involves the introduction of a secure checkout page and customer accounts that will elevate the overall satisfaction of our users and complete the shopping experience. 

Throughout the development process, we focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. By leveraging technologies such as React, Tailwind, MUI, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we ensured a responsive and interactive website design. Additionally, AJAX technology was utilized to fetch data from the Fake Store API in real-time, providing a seamless user experience without page reloads.

The Fake Store E-Commerce Website project provided us with valuable learning experiences in web development using React, Javascript and API integration. We acquired a deeper understanding of front-end technologies and how to leverage external APIs to enrich website functionality. Working collaboratively, we overcame the challenges of remote project development through effective communication and code management practices.

We are excited to present the Fake Store E-Commerce Website, aiming to deliver an immersive and enjoyable online shopping experience for users.

The results page displays the products in cards, with the imagery, title and price clearly displayed. An 'add to cart' button adds interactivity to the page and products will be added to the shopping cart page. The figure will increase in the navbar cart icon according to how many items are added.
